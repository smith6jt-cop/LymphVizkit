## Spatial Neighborhood Analysis (Phase 7, Feb 2026 — extended Apr 2026)

### Peri-Follicle Metrics (~100 columns, all phenotypes systematic)

| Category | Columns | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Peri-follicle composition | `peri_prop_*`, `peri_count_*`, `total_cells_peri` | Proportion & count for each of 21 phenotypes in 20µm expansion zone |
| Aggregate immune metrics (legacy) | `immune_frac_peri/core`, `immune_ratio`, `cd8_to_macro_ratio`, `tcell_density_peri` | Immune fractions, ratios, density. Columns retained for compatibility but no longer surfaced in any UI. |
| Enrichment z-scores (per phenotype) | `enrich_z_<phenotype>` | Poisson z (observed vs tissue-baseline) for **all 20 phenotypes** (excludes "Unknown"). Extended Apr 2026 from a hand-curated 7-immune subset. |
| Distance metrics (per phenotype) | `min_dist_<phenotype>`, `min_dist_immune_mean` | Min distance from follicle core centroid to nearest peri cell of each phenotype, plus the aggregate "any immune" mean across the 7 IMMUNE_TYPES. |

### Data Flow

`compute_neighborhood_metrics.py` reads single-cell H5AD -> `neighborhood_metrics.csv` (5,214 rows) -> merged into `follicle_explorer.h5ad` `.obs` by `build_h5ad_for_app.py` (step 4.5) -> extracted in `data_loading.R` `load_master_h5ad()` -> merged into `comp` by `prep_data()` -> available in Plot composition selector (4 option groups) + Statistics tab + Spatial tab.

### Key Details

- All 5,214 follicles have peri-follicle data (100% coverage with min_cells=0 + require_paired=True)
- Column naming sanitizes phenotype names: spaces -> `_`, `+` -> `plus` (e.g., `peri_prop_ECADplus`)
- Immune signal validated: T1D immune_frac_peri (0.155) > Aab+ (0.106) > ND (0.069)
- **Plot composition selector** has 3 option groups: Hormone Positivity, Phenotype Proportions, Peri-Follicle Proportions. The 5 aggregate ratio metrics were removed (Apr 2026) in favour of phenotype-driven Spatial UI selectors.
- **`IMMUNE_TYPES`** in `compute_neighborhood_metrics.py` (CD8a Tcell, CD4 Tcell, T cell, B cell, Macrophage, APCs, Immune) is intentionally narrow — drives only aggregates where "what counts as immune" needs definition. **`per_type_phenotypes`** (all `obs.phenotype.unique()` minus `PER_TYPE_EXCLUDE = {"Unknown"}`) drives `enrich_z_*` and `min_dist_*` per-phenotype loops.

### Spatial Tab Layout (Phase 9+13+15, mod_spatial_ui/server.R)

Row 1: Controls sidebar (col-2) + Tissue Scatter (col-6) + Leiden Panel (col-4). Row 2-4: Neighborhood Analysis Cards (A/B/C).

1. **Controls Sidebar** (col-2) -- donor selector, color-by (phenotype/Leiden), Leiden resolution, region filter (All/Core+Peri/Core), "Color background cells" checkbox, phenotype filter (checkboxes with All/None links), donor status checkboxes, phenotype + donor palette selectors, download button.
2. **Tissue Scatter** (col-6) -- ggplot2 `renderPlot` (NOT plotly) showing ~177K cells/donor. Background tissue cells in light grey or colored by phenotype (toggle). Foreground (core/peri) colored by phenotype or Leiden cluster. `coord_fixed() + scale_y_reverse()`. Height: 800px. Supports brush-to-zoom.
3. **Leiden Panel** (col-4) -- plotly UMAP of 5,214 follicles colored by selected Leiden resolution (0.3/0.5/0.8/1.0) + stacked bar chart of mean phenotype composition per cluster. UMAP uses raw marker PCA visualization coords (same as trajectory).
4. **Neighborhood Analysis Cards** (3 sections, conditionally rendered via `has_neighborhood()` guard). Apr 2026: all four card selectors are now phenotype-driven and dynamically populated from `prepared()$comp` columns.
   - **Global controls bar**: Min cells/follicle filter, point size, opacity, live follicle count.
   - **Card A: Peri-Follicle Phenotype Enrichment** -- Bar chart (donor-level mean/median enrichment z-score per status for selected phenotype) + peri vs core proportion scatter. Inputs: `infiltration_phenotype`, `scatter_phenotype`.
   - **Card B: Phenotype Composition & Enrichment** -- Grouped bar chart + heatmap across all 20 phenotypes × 3 stages. Region toggle: peri enrichment z-scores (diverging blue→red), core proportions (sequential white→red), peri proportions (sequential white→red).
   - **Card C: Phenotype Proximity to Follicle** -- **Left:** per-follicle distance box plots (`distance_metric`, `min_dist_*` columns). **Right (rebuilt Jul 2026):** per-cell signed-distance-to-follicle, two views via `input$dist_ptype`: (1) **Density** — one population (a phenotype, a **RESTORE-marker+** subset via `dist_mode`+`dist_group` with an "All (all cells)" option, or all cells) as a density split by status, on a **symlog distance axis** (fine increments across the follicle interior + peri-follicle, coarser out in bulk tissue); (2) **Composition** — several RESTORE markers (`dist_comp_markers` multi-select) as **small-multiple stacked bars** (one panel per status) showing marker composition vs distance, always spanning and marking **x=0 (the follicle border)**. Its **own** `dist_status` toggle is independent of the sidebar. All from the single `cell_distance` DuckDB view; the old `immune_distance_kde.csv` path (never existed → blank) is retired.
   - Section headings reuse `section_heading()` pattern (gradient pill badge + title + subtitle).
   - Distance NA values: caused by zero immune cells in peri-follicle zone (20.1% NA for any immune, 88.6% for CD8+ T-cells). Biological, not a bug. Min-cells filter at ≥50 reduces NA from 20% to 6%.

Wired as `spatial_server("spatial", prepared, active_palette, active_donor_colors)`.

#### Neighborhood Cards Server Architecture
- `nbr_comp()` shared reactive -- filters `prepared()$comp` by `input$groups` + `input$nbr_min_cells`. Reused by all 6 outputs.
- `phenotype_options()` reactive (Apr 2026) -- builds a list of phenotype records from `prepared()$comp` columns. Each entry: `label`, `safe`, `enrich`, `prop_core`, `peri_prop`, `peri_count`, `min_dist`. Recovers original phenotype label from sanitised column suffix by trying common transforms (`_` → space, `plus` → `+`).
- `phenotype_choices()` reactive -- named vector for `selectInput` choices: names = labels, values = safe-names. All four card selectors populate via `updateSelectInput` from this.
- `enrich_summary()` intermediate reactive -- iterates over `phenotype_options()` per cell type × donor status. Respects `input$enrich_region`, `input$enrich_clip`, `input$enrich_stat`.
- All 6 outputs use `donor_colors_reactive()` for palette syncing.
- **Plotly categorical axis ordering**: Must set `categoryorder = "array", categoryarray = c("ND", "Aab+", "T1D")` on x-axis. Plotly defaults to alphabetical, which puts "Aab+" before "ND".
- **Card C right plot — per-cell distance (Jul 2026)**: `output$immune_distance_kde` is a per-cell signed-distance view over the single `cell_distance` DuckDB view (`donor_status, cell_region, phenotype, dist_follicle` + 10 RESTORE `{m}_pos` booleans), aggregated **in SQL** so only a tiny result crosses into R. **Density** (`query_cell_distance_hist`): a filled curve per status for a phenotype (`phenotype = ?`), a RESTORE marker (`"{m}_pos"`), or all cells, **binned uniformly in symlog space** (`sign(x)·log10(1+|x|/CD_SYMLOG_C)`, C=25 — computed inline in SQL) so bins are ~1–2 µm across the follicle border and grow to tens of µm in bulk tissue; `x` is the symlog position (real-µm tick labels via `cd_symlog_ticks()`), `y` = cells per **real** µm, dashed line at 0. Range is **asymmetric**: `lo = least(0.1%-quantile, -50)` — the inside is physically bounded (~−90 µm) and is the region of interest, so it is never percentile-clipped above 0 (a symmetric 1% clip sits *above* zero for outside-heavy markers like CD3e/macrophages and would hide their real intra-follicle cells); `hi` = 99th pct trims the unbounded far-tissue tail. **Composition** (`query_cell_distance_composition`): per-`(status, bin, marker)` positive counts → **small-multiple stacked bars** (`plotly::subplot` rows = status; `offsetgroup` side-by-side grouping renders muddy at these densities). Composition x-range is clamped to a near-follicle window (`max(2pct,-100)`…`min(98pct,300)` µm of the selected markers' positive cells — else ubiquitous CD31/Vimentin stretch it to ~1.4 mm), then **forced to straddle 0** (`min(lo,-30)…max(hi,30)`) with bin edges **anchored at 0** (`floor(dist/bw)`), so the follicle border is always shown, a bar boundary sits on it, and the render draws a dashed border line at x=0 in every facet. **Marker positivity = RESTORE `_pos`** (per-image calibrated threshold on REDSEA-corrected MFI, NOT a raw-intensity heuristic). The `dist_group` dropdown is populated by `observeEvent(input$dist_mode)` (can't race the mount — the input must exist to fire). **`dist_status` is authoritative for this plot only** (does NOT read the sidebar `input$groups`). **SQL gotcha**: `dist_follicle` is signed, so the bin offset is parenthesised `(dist_follicle - (%f))` — a negative `lo` otherwise yields `--`, a SQL line comment that truncates the query. **Bar gotcha**: bar traces render `text` as on-bar labels — use `hovertext` + `textposition="none"`. View registered in `00_globals.R`; data built by `scripts/senior/build_cell_distance_parquet.py` (row-order join of cells↔tissue for phenotype + `object_id` join of `restore_gated_redsea` `_pos` + coord-agreement assert).

#### Supporting Files
- `spatial_helpers.R` -- `donor_tissue_available()`, `get_available_donors()`, `load_donor_tissue(imageid)` with `new.env()` caching; plus the Card C right-plot helpers `cell_distance_view_ready()`, `cell_distance_phenotypes()`, `cell_distance_markers()` (the 10 RESTORE markers), `query_cell_distance_hist()` (density), `query_cell_distance_composition()` (bars), and `CELL_DIST_MARKER_COLORS`
- `data/donors/{imageid}.csv` -- 15 per-donor CSVs (5 cols: X_centroid, Y_centroid, phenotype, cell_region, follicle_name), ~78 MB total
- `data/parquet/cell_distance/case_id=*/part-0.parquet` -- per-cell `donor_status, cell_region, phenotype, dist_follicle` + 10 RESTORE `{m}_pos` booleans (INS, GCG, SST, CD3e, CD20, CD163, CD31, SMA, Vimentin, Pan_Cytokeratin) for the Card C right plot; 23.3M cells, ~244 MB; `cell_distance` DuckDB view. Built by `scripts/senior/build_cell_distance_parquet.py` (row-order join of the tissue-parquet phenotype + `object_id` join of the `data/restore_gated_redsea/` `_pos` calls).
- `follicles_core_clustered.h5ad` -- Leiden clustering source (4 resolutions: leiden_0.3/0.5/0.8/1.0)

#### Tissue Scatter Design
- Uses `ggplot2::renderPlot` NOT plotly -- 177K points would freeze plotly
- Foreground/background layering: tissue cells at `size=0.15, alpha=0.3` in grey; core/peri at `size=0.4, alpha=0.6` in color
- Leiden coloring maps `follicle_name -> cluster` via follicle-level lookup from `prepared()$comp`
- **Brush-to-zoom**: `plotOutput(brush=brushOpts(...), dblclick=...)` + `reactiveValues(xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax)`. When zoomed, switches from `coord_fixed()` to `coord_cartesian(xlim, ylim)` with `sort()` on ylim for reversed y-axis.
- **Phenotype filter**: `checkboxGroupInput` with All/None action links. Dynamically populated from donor's unique phenotypes.
- Donor 6533 has 191 follicles (9,815 core + 13,840 peri cells) — fully integrated after patching Parent annotations.
