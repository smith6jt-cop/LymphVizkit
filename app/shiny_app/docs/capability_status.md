# LymphVizkit (Senior) — App Capability Status

**Assessed:** 2026-06-29 · **Method:** the dev server was booted
(`Rscript -e 'shiny::runApp(".", port=7777)'`, `RETICULATE_PYTHON` → `scvi-env`) and every tab was
loaded and screenshotted in a headless browser. Verdicts below are what the **running app actually
did**, not a code read. Screenshots are in `docs/img/capability/`.

## Headline

- The app **boots cleanly** and **all 5 data tabs are functional** on the data currently on disk
  (Viewer needs images — see below).
- **Trajectory works** — an earlier "broken" call was a **premature 8s screenshot**. The tab was
  merely **slow to first render** (~10–30s): `traj_data_clean` ran a 9,130-iteration
  `get_follicle_annotations` loop, each scanning the full 9.6k-row spatial lookup (~88M comparisons per
  render). **Fixed 2026-06-29** by vectorizing that lookup into one `match()` (renders instantly).
  The "follicle-key join" was a red herring — the keys (`Follicle_755` both sides) match perfectly.
- **Viewer now serves per-donor OME-TIFFs for the full 22-donor cohort** (Jul 2026). The `.qptiff`
  slides are converted to pyramidal, tiled OME-TIFF via `scripts/senior/convert_viewer_ometiff.sh`
  (bioformats2raw 0.12.1 → raw2ometiff 0.10.0, Baseline series only, LZW) into
  `/data/follicle_ome_tiff/<case_id>.ome.tiff` (+ `<case_id>.offsets.json`), surfaced through the
  `www/local_images` symlink. Donor **6539 verified end-to-end** in Avivator (follicles render;
  INS/GCG/SST/DAPI defaults correct; 2 mm scale bar; 5-level pyramid) —
  `/data/follicle_ome_tiff/verification_6539.png`. All 22 convert via the resumable batch
  (`… all22`). The cohort **mixes panels** (batch-1 SST@35 / batch-2 SST@1, some 58-ch) so the
  channel_config was made **name-based** (`build_channel_config_b64` emits INS/GCG/SST/DAPI by name;
  Avivator resolves them against each image's own OME-XML) — correct defaults for every donor.
  **Avivator requires HTTP Range (206)** — production nginx/shiny-server provides it; the dev
  `runApp` (httpuv) does **not**, so images render only under the deployed server, not `shiny::runApp`.
- **Every tab still serves the OLD provisional fine phenotypes** (Beta cell, Alpha cell,
  M2 macrophage, NK cell, Regulatory T cell, Stromal, …). The new REDSEA/RESTORE/broad-lineage
  outputs are **intentionally not wired into the app** — they live only in the phenotyping notebook
  (`notebooks/senior_phenotyping_redsea_restore.ipynb`). No app data rebuild was requested.

Startup log confirmed: DuckDB views `follicles` + `tissue` registered; 4 mirai workers; 9,677 follicle
spatial records. The channel sidecar is now the **59-channel Senior panel** (`app/shiny_app/Channel_names`,
regenerated from the qptiff biomarker order; the old 35-plex Junior file is backed up as
`Channel_names.junior35.bak`); `www/local_images` → `/data/follicle_ome_tiff`.

## Per-tab matrix

| Tab | Verdict | Evidence (screenshot) | Notes |
|-----|---------|-----------------------|-------|
| **Plot** | ✅ Works | `plot.png` | Sidebar filters, "Insulin⁺ fraction vs Follicle Size" scatter (clean ND↘ / Aab+↗ / T1D-low biology), donor-group violin, AI panel — all render. Drill-down controls present (9,706 per-follicle CSVs + 15 GeoJSONs on disk). |
| **Trajectory** | ✅ Works (was slow) | `trajectory.png` (8s, mid-load) → after 30s the pseudotime scatter (INS vs pseudotime, ND/Aab+/T1D + trend lines) + both UMAPs render fully. Slow first render was vectorized away 2026-06-29. |
| **Viewer** | ✅ Works (images added Jul 2026) | `verification_6539.png` | Per-donor 59-plex OME-TIFFs from `convert_viewer_ometiff.sh`, served via `www/local_images` → `/data/follicle_ome_tiff`. Donor 6539 verified rendering in Avivator with correct INS/GCG/SST/DAPI defaults + `6539.offsets.json` (Viv IFD index). Requires Range-serving (prod nginx/shiny-server), not `runApp`. |
| **Statistics** | ✅ Works | `statistics.png` | Full narrative + Configure Analysis controls + Run Statistics / Download CSV. Result panels (Hypothesis Testing, Effect-Size Forest, AUC) populate **on demand** after Run Statistics; the donor-aware (N=15) mixed-effects workflow is wired. |
| **Spatial** | ✅ Works | `spatial.png` | Tissue scatter renders **145,651 foreground cells** for donor 115 via the **DuckDB tissue backend** (no per-donor CSV fallback needed); Leiden UMAP (9,130 follicles, clusters 0–14), Donor-Status UMAP, and "Mean Phenotype Composition by Cluster" all render. |
| **Drill-Down** *(embedded in Plot/Trajectory)* | ✅ Works via Plot | — | Per-follicle segmentation + single-cell overlay is driven by a click on a scatter point. Functional from **Plot** (cell CSVs + GeoJSONs present); unusable from **Trajectory** only because that scatter is empty. |
| **AI Assistant** *(Plot side-panel)* | ✅ Renders | `plot.png` | "Panc Floyd" panel + model selector (Navigator `gpt-oss-20b`) shown and ready. Live chat needs UF Navigator API creds in `.Renviron` (not validated here). |

## The Trajectory "failure" — what it actually was (and the fix)

Not a bug in the data or the join — a **performance** problem plus a premature screenshot. Diagnosis
(2026-06-29):

- The trajectory data is fully valid: all **9,130** follicles pass the filters for INS (`dpt_pseudotime`
  finite 0–1, INS expression finite, `follicle_key`/`case_id` present). The server log even shows
  `[traj_data_clean] Successfully processed 9130 observations for INS`.
- The follicle keys match perfectly on both sides (`Follicle_755`), so there is **no join defect** —
  `prep_data()` already calls `add_follicle_key()` on `comp`, and `traj()` synthesizes
  `combined_follicle_id`. The "0 follicle metrics" line in the first screenshot was the **initial frame**
  before `input$traj_feature` propagated.
- The real cost was `traj_data_clean` calling `get_follicle_annotations()` **once per follicle** (9,130×),
  each scanning the full 9.6k-row `follicle_spatial_lookup` — ~88M comparisons **on every render**
  (feature change, filter change). First render took ~10–30s, so the 8s screenshot caught an empty
  tab.

**Fix (`mod_trajectory_server.R`):** replaced that per-row loop with a single vectorized `match()`
against the lookup (identical result, O(n)). The full render (pseudotime scatter + both UMAPs) was
verified working via screenshot; the `match()` returns the same `centroid_x/y_um`/`has_spatial`
columns as the loop (same first-match semantics, same lookup columns), so it only changes speed.

## Other observations

- **No Excel fallback.** `data/app_data/master_results.xlsx` is absent, so `load_master_auto()` has a
  single point of failure: if the H5AD / reticulate-`anndata` path ever fails, the app won't load.
  (It loaded fine here with `RETICULATE_PYTHON` pointed at `scvi-env`.)
- **DuckDB backend is doing real work** — the Spatial tissue scatter (145k+ cells) comes from
  `data/parquet/tissue` via partition pruning, confirming `LYMPH_USE_DUCKDB=TRUE` is engaged.
- **OLD-vs-new phenotypes.** The Spatial phenotype list still shows the full provisional taxonomy
  (Acinar, Ductal, CD4/CD8 T cell, M2 macrophage, NK cell, Regulatory T cell, Stromal, …). The
  notebook's broad-lineage output (6 classes) is a separate, QC'd artifact and is not surfaced in the
  app by design.

## Reproduce

```bash
cd app/shiny_app
RETICULATE_PYTHON=/home/smith6jt/miniconda3/envs/scvi-env/bin/python \
  Rscript -e 'shiny::runApp(".", port = 7777, host = "127.0.0.1")'
# then load http://127.0.0.1:7777 and click through Plot / Trajectory / Viewer / Statistics / Spatial
```
